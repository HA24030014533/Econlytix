WASHINGTON—In a dramatic escalation of the U.S.-China tech war, Congress is pushing to mandate GPS-style tracking for every advanced AI chip exported from American manufacturers, transforming semiconductors into global surveillance devices. The Chip Security Act, introduced on May 15 by a bipartisan coalition led by Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) and Bill Foster (D-IL), represents the most invasive regulatory measure yet in efforts to prevent cutting-edge technology from reaching adversarial nations[3][4][6].

The legislation responds to widespread smuggling of Nvidia and AMD chips into China despite existing export bans, with Huawei’s Ascend AI processors reportedly matching U.S. performance benchmarks using illicitly obtained components[11][17]. By embedding location verification mechanisms directly into chips, the bill aims to create an unbroken chain of custody from Silicon Valley fabs to end-users—a move experts compare to installing “LoJack for the digital age”[4][12].

## The Chip Security Act: From Export Controls to Real-Time Surveillance

The proposed law mandates that all AI chips classified under Export Control Classification Numbers 3A090 and 4A090 include hardware/software capable of geolocation verification using GPS or delay-based signal timing to confirm country-level positioning, tamper detection to alert U.S. authorities if chips are physically modified or moved without authorization, and usage monitoring to report computational workloads that suggest military AI applications[6][9][12][15].

> “This isn’t just about knowing where chips are—it’s about knowing *what they’re doing*,” said Foster, a physicist and former chip designer who co-authored the bill[7]. The requirements apply retroactively to all chips shipped since January 2024, forcing manufacturers like Nvidia to update firmware across existing data center deployments[12].

While the bill’s text references “GPS tracking,” engineers emphasize that pure satellite-based systems are too easily spoofed. Instead, a hybrid approach using **delay-based location verification** is gaining traction[9]. This method calculates a chip’s position by measuring signal round-trip times to trusted U.S. servers, leveraging the speed-of-light constant for accuracy within 200 kilometers[9][15].

As the Chip Security Act moves through markup, it reflects a broader philosophical shift in tech policy. “We’ve moved from ‘keep them out’ to ‘watch them always,’” summarized CSIS senior fellow James Lewis. With quantum computing poised to disrupt encryption itself, such invasive measures may become standard across industries[10][11]. For now, the bill’s fate rests with Senate moderates. But as Huawei’s latest 3-nanometer breakthrough shows, America’s tech dominance is no longer guaranteed—and desperation breeds radical solutions[11][17]. In the words of Rep. Huizenga: “Either we control the chips, or they control us”[6].
