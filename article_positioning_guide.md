# Admin Panel: Easy Guide to Placing Your Articles

This guide helps you understand how to use the settings in the admin panel to choose where and how your articles show up on the website. Knowing these settings will help you control your content's visibility.

## Catchy Headline Snippet (`hero_bullet`)

**What it does:** This is like a short, punchy teaser for your article. Think of it as the exciting "sound bite" that grabs attention when your article is in a prime spot (a "hero section").

**What happens when you use it:** If your article is set to be a "hero" (a main, highlighted article), this special text will be shown off, often as a big headline or a quick summary to draw readers in.

**How to use it in Admin:**
1.  When you're editing or creating a post, look for a text box labeled 'Hero Bullet'.
2.  Type your catchy snippet here.
3.  Remember, this snippet will only appear if you've also chosen a "hero" spot for your article in the 'Display Area' setting (see below).

## Where Your Article Appears (`display_settings.display_area`)

**What it does:** Think of this like choosing which part of a newspaper or magazine your article goes into. Do you want it on the front page, in a special feature section, or somewhere else? This setting decides the main spot for your article.

**Available Options & What They Mean (Examples):**
*   `Default`: The standard place for articles.
*   `Homepage Hero`: Puts your article in the biggest spotlight on your homepage, like the main headline story.
*   `Homepage Featured`: Highlights your article on the homepage, but maybe not as the absolute main story.
*   `Homepage Grid`: Shows your article as part of a picture-based grid on the homepage.
*   `Homepage List`: Displays your article in a list format on the homepage.
*   `Sidebar Featured`: Shows your article in a special box on the side of your pages.
*   `Sidebar Recent`: Lists your article in the "recent posts" section, usually in the sidebar.
*   `Category Hero`: Makes your article the main, highlighted piece for its specific category page.
*   `Category Featured`: Features your article prominently on its category page.
*   `Archive Hero`: Highlights your article on archive pages (like pages showing all posts from a certain month).
*   `Archive Featured`: Features your article on archive pages.

**What happens when you choose an option:** This directly controls where your article is mainly shown (e.g., homepage, sidebar, category pages) and how important it looks (e.g., a hero story or a featured item). For example, picking 'Homepage Hero' makes your article the star of the homepage.

**How to use it in Admin:**
1.  When editing a post, find the 'Display Settings' area.
2.  Look for a dropdown menu called 'Display Area'.
3.  Click it and pick the spot where you want your article to shine!

## How Your Article Looks (`display_settings.layout_style`)

**What it does:** This setting is about the visual style of your article in its chosen 'Display Area'. It's like deciding if your article should look like a big headline story, a compact news brief, or something else.

**Available Options & What They Mean (Examples):**
*   `Standard`: The usual, default look.
*   `Full-Width`: Makes your article stretch across the whole width of the page or section.
*   `Compact`: Shows your article in a smaller, more condensed format.
*   `Card`: Presents your article in a neat box, like a playing card.
*   `Featured Large`: Makes the article look big and important, often used for featured content.
*   `Hero Left/Center/Hero Right`: If it's a "hero" article, this decides if the text and images are aligned to the left, center, or right.
*   `Opinion Style`: Gives it a look often used for opinion pieces or editorials.
*   `Grid Item`: Styles the article to fit nicely into a grid layout.

**What happens when you choose an option:** This changes how your article is styled and arranged. For example, 'Full-Width' gives it more space, while 'Card' makes it a distinct block. 'Hero Left/Center/Right' helps position content within those big hero displays.

**How to use it in Admin:**
1.  In the 'Display Settings' section of the post editor, find the 'Layout Style' dropdown.
2.  Choose the style that best fits your article and where you've decided to place it with the 'Display Area' setting.

## Making Your Article Stand Out in Columns (`display_settings.column_priority`)

**What it does:** This setting helps you control how much attention your article gets, especially if it's in a layout with multiple columns (like a news website with several articles side-by-side).

**Available Options & What They Mean (Examples):**
*   `Standard`: Normal priority in the column.
*   `Full-Width`: Like a banner headline, this makes your article stretch across all available columns in that section.
*   `Highlight Left/Highlight Right`: Makes your article stand out, perhaps by taking up more space or having a special background, on the left or right side of a multi-column area.
*   `Sticky`: Think of this like a Post-it note that stays at the top! It keeps your article visible at the top of its list or column, even if visitors scroll down.
*   `Prominent`: This gives your article extra visual punch, making it a "banner headline" or a more eye-catching piece compared to others around it.

**What happens when you choose an option:** This affects how noticeable your article is in column-based layouts. 'Full-Width' makes it unmissable. 'Sticky' keeps it in view. 'Prominent' uses styling to make it pop.

**How to use it in Admin:**
1.  In the 'Display Settings' for your post, look for the 'Column Priority' dropdown.
2.  Pick an option to manage how your article appears in layouts with columns. This is most useful if its 'Display Area' or 'Layout Style' uses a grid or columns.

## Arranging Your Articles: Manual Order (`display_settings.display_order`)

**What it does:** This lets you decide the exact order your articles appear in lists or specific sections, overriding automatic sorting (like by date).

**What happens when you use it:** Articles are sorted by the number you enter here. Lower numbers come first. So, an article with 'Display Order' set to `1` will show up before an article set to `2` in the same list.

**How to use it in Admin:**
1.  In 'Display Settings', find the 'Display Order' field (it will likely be a box where you can type a number).
2.  Enter a whole number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
3.  If you have several articles in the same 'Display Area' and want them in a specific sequence, use this field. If you don't set a number, articles will usually be sorted by date or another default way.

## How Long to Keep an Article "Featured" (`display_settings.featured_until`)

**What it does:** This lets you set a "sell-by date" for your article's featured status. If you want an article to be highlighted only for a limited time, this is the tool.

**What happens when you use it:** Your article will be treated as "featured" (for example, in a 'Homepage Featured' spot) only until the date and time you set here. After that, it might go back to being a regular article or be removed from the featured spots, depending on how your website is set up.

**How to use it in Admin:**
1.  In 'Display Settings', look for 'Featured Until'. This will likely be a calendar and time selector.
2.  Choose the date and time when the article should stop being featured.
3.  This is great for news that's only relevant for a short period or for temporary promotions.

## Hiding Articles from General Lists (`display_settings.hide_from_lists`)

**What it does:** This option lets you keep an article from showing up in the usual places people browse, like category pages, archive pages (e.g., "all posts from May"), or other general lists of content.

**What happens when you use it:** If you check this box, people won't find the article by just browsing through categories or archives. However, they can still see it if they have a direct link. Plus, you can still choose to show it in very specific, hand-picked spots (like 'Homepage Hero' or 'Sidebar Featured') using the 'Display Area' setting.

**How to use it in Admin:**
1.  In 'Display Settings', find the 'Hide From Lists' checkbox.
2.  Tick this box if you want the article to be a bit more exclusive â€“ accessible by a direct link or if you specifically place it somewhere prominent, but not in the general flow of posts.
