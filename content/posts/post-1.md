A seismic shift in quantum computing research has upended assumptions about the durability of Bitcoin’s cryptographic defenses. A paper published this week by Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney reveals that quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods with far fewer resources than previously estimated—a development with profound implications for Bitcoin’s security model and the broader digital economy[^1](https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/google-publishes-scientific-paper-that-could-change-what-we-know-about-bitcoin-20-times-easier-to-break-than-previously-thought/)[^3](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html).

The study, which slashed the qubit requirements for factoring 2048-bit RSA integers by 20-fold, underscores accelerating risks to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)—the mathematical backbone of Bitcoin’s digital signatures. While current quantum systems remain years away from executing such attacks, the research signals that the window for preemptive action may be narrowing faster than anticipated[^4](https://dig.watch/updates/quantum-computers-might-break-bitcoin-security-faster-than-thought).

## Quantum Leap: From 20 Million to 1 Million Qubits

Gidney’s findings, detailed in *How to Factor 2048 Bit RSA Integers With Less Than a Million Noisy Qubits*, revise a 2019 estimate co-authored with Martin Ekerå. Where earlier models suggested breaking RSA-2048 encryption would demand 20 million qubits, algorithmic refinements and error-correction breakthroughs now posit that under 1 million qubits could achieve the feat in less than a week[^3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15917)[^12](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.15917v1). Though Bitcoin relies on ECC rather than RSA, both systems face analogous vulnerabilities to Shor’s algorithm—a quantum method for solving discrete logarithm problems[^1](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/can-you-break-ecc-with-quantum-computing-win-1-bitcoin-in-this-groundbreaking-competition/)[^10](https://beincrypto.com/quantum-computing-bitcoin-encryption-threat/).

“This isn’t just about RSA, said Dr. Carlos Pérez-Delgado, a quantum cryptographer at the Quantum Resistant Ledger Foundation. “The same principles apply to elliptic curves. If quantum efficiency improves here, it compresses the timeline for all public-key cryptography”[^8](https://www.theqrl.org/blog/preparing-bitcoin-for-the-postquantum-era-insights-from-quantum-computing-experts/).

The implications are stark: A sufficiently advanced quantum computer could derive private keys from public addresses, enabling asset theft or transaction forgery. Project Eleven, a quantum research consortium, estimates over 6 million BTC—worth approximately $500 billion—reside in wallets with exposed public keys, making them priority targets[^7](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech).

## Bitcoin’s Quantum Achilles’ Heel

Bitcoin’s security architecture hinges on two cryptographic pillars: the SHA-256 hash function and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). While SHA-256 is considered quantum-resistant, ECDSA relies on the computational difficulty of reversing elliptic curve operations—a task Shor’s algorithm simplifies exponentially[^6](https://beincrypto.com/quantum-computing-bitcoin-encryption-threat/)[^14](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech).

“The moment a quantum computer can run Shor’s algorithm at scale, every exposed public key becomes a liability,” explained Michael Strike, co-author of *Downtime Required for Bitcoin Quantum Safety*. “This isn’t theoretical. It’s a countdown clock”[^8](https://www.theqrl.org/blog/preparing-bitcoin-for-the-postquantum-era-insights-from-quantum-computing-experts/).

Critical vulnerabilities exist in two scenarios:

1. **Reused Addresses**: Bitcoin’s original Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses reveal public keys immediately, while reused Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses expose keys upon first spending[^6](https://www.deloitte.com/nl/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html).
2. **Mempool Transactions**: Unconfirmed transactions broadcast to the network provide a brief window for quantum adversaries to crack keys and alter destinations[^14](https://www.deloitte.com/nl/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html).

Deloitte analysis suggests 25% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply—including Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant 1.1 million BTC—resides in high-risk addresses[^6](https://cryptoslate.com/wsj-reheats-bitcoins-quantum-hack-concerns-researcher-calls-it-a-time-bomb/).

## Industry Response: Patchwork Progress

The crypto sector’s response has been fragmented. While projects like Algorand and Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) have adopted NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms, Bitcoin’s decentralized governance complicates protocol upgrades[^14](https://www.deloitte.com/nl/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html).

A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) dubbed *QuBit* seeks to incentivize migration via discounted fees for quantum-resistant addresses. Modeled after Segregated Witness’s adoption push, the plan would introduce Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash (P2QRH) addresses using lattice-based cryptography[^6](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/project-eleven-challenges-quantum-devs-to-break-ecc-for-1-btc/).

“Economic incentives drove SegWit adoption, and they’ll drive this," said pseudonymous QuBit author Hunter Beast. “But we’re racing against an invisible deadline”[^6](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-quantum-computer-threat-timeline-solutions-2024-2035/).

Institutional investors are taking note. BlackRock’s May 2025 iShares Bitcoin Trust filing added quantum risk to its disclosures—a first for a major asset manager. “It’s a recognition that crypto can’t ignore macro-technological shifts,” said Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer[^14](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech).

## The 2030s: Quantum’s Make-or-Break Decade

Consensus among experts pegs the 2030s as quantum computing’s pivotal decade. IBM’s roadmap targets 4,000-qubit systems by 2033, while NIST recommends transitioning critical infrastructure to post-quantum standards by 2035[^6](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech).

“Today’s 1,100-qubit machines are toys compared to what’s needed,” said Google Quantum AI engineer Hartmut Neven. “But if qubit counts double annually, we hit danger zones faster than expected”[^1](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/significant-theoretical-advancement-in-factoring-2048-bit-rsa-integers/).

The Q-Day Prize, a $1 million bounty for breaking ECC keys on quantum hardware, has become a bellwether. Though no participant has cracked even 25-bit keys, Project Eleven’s competition highlights the arms-race dynamic[^5](https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/q-day-prize-quantum-computing-break-bitcoin/)[^16](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/project-eleven-challenges-quantum-devs-to-break-ecc-for-1-btc/).

## Beyond Bitcoin: A Cryptographic Reckoning

The quantum threat extends far beyond cryptocurrency. RSA and ECC undergird global finance, healthcare, and defense systems. Google has already begun implementing hybrid encryption—mixing classical and post-quantum algorithms—in its internal networks[^3](https://quantumzeitgeist.substack.com/p/million-qubit-quantum-factoring-a).

NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, which finalized Falcon and CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithms in 2024, offers a blueprint. Yet migration costs and compatibility hurdles linger, particularly for legacy systems[^14](https://www.deloitte.com/nl/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html).

“This isn’t a crypto problem; it’s an internet problem,” said Tim Bozman, quantum lead at the World Economic Forum. “The longer industries wait, the higher the disruption cost”[^14](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech).

## Conclusion: Preparing for the Inevitable

While immediate quantum threats remain speculative, Gidney’s research underscores a non-negotiable truth: Cryptographic inertia is a luxury the digital age can no longer afford. For Bitcoin, the path forward involves balancing network security with decentralized consensus—a challenge as complex as the mathematics it seeks to replace.

> As Sirer summarized: “The apocalypse isn’t tomorrow, but the forecast just got darker. Prepare accordingly”[^14](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech).
